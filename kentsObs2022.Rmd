# General

In the year 2022, I recorded a personal record number of observations and species. I recorded `r nObs22` observations representing an increase of `r perChgYr`% from my previous record in 2021, of which `r perRG22`% are research grade, meaning their identification has been confirmed by a third party. Of my `r nObs22` observations in 2022, `r nUni22` were unique species. The `r nUni22` unique species from 2022 is also a personal record for me and represents a `r spPerChg`% increase from my previous record in 2021. My observations in 2022 came from `r nCountry` country, and `r nProvince` provinces. In 2022, I continued to focus on the subphylem vertebrata clade of which `r perVerts`% of my observations came from. In 2022, I had `r nLifer22` lifers (first time observed in my life) which was `r perChgLifer`% higher than 2021.

# Geography

All of my observations from 2022 were located within `r nProvince` provinces in Canada. **Figure 1** shows the locations of my observations by kingdom from 2022. The observations are labelled with the common names of the organism observed. Time observed and the taxonomy of the observation can be viewed by clicking on the observation.

As shown in **Figure 1**, most of my observations were concentrated in specific regions including Tommy Thompson Park in Toronto, Ontario, and Meadowbrook in Titusville, New Brunswick.

**Figure 1**
```{r observation_map}
observations <- obs22 %>% 
  dplyr::select(longitude, latitude,
         time_observed_at,
         taxon_kingdom_name, taxon_phylum_name, taxon_class_name,
         taxon_order_name, taxon_family_name, taxon_genus_name,
         taxon_species_name,
         common_name, quality_grade, taxon_geoprivacy) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(latitude))

observations <- observations %>% 
  rename(kingdom = taxon_kingdom_name, phylum = taxon_phylum_name, `class` = taxon_class_name,
        `order` = taxon_order_name, family = taxon_family_name, genus = taxon_genus_name,
        species = taxon_species_name)


observations <- st_as_sf(x = observations, 
                         coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                         crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")

mapview(observations,
        zcol = "kingdom",
        label = "common_name",
        legend = TRUE,
        legend.name = c("kingdom"))

rm(observations)
```

```{r county_species}

# Toronto
toronto <- obs22 %>% 
  filter(place_admin2_name == "Toronto") %>% 
  group_by(taxon_species_name) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  nrow()
  
# Kings County
kings <- obs22 %>% 
  filter(place_admin2_name == "Kings") %>% 
  group_by(taxon_species_name) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  nrow()


```


**Figure 2** show the number of species observed in each province, and in each county within the province. By sliding the by from left to right, the view can be altered from the county to province level. Both in Ontario and New Brunswick, the species I observe are concentrated around large bodies of water. Living in Toronto, Ontario, most of the species occur around the north shore of Lake Ontario, with a few further north and further west. Toronto is the county with the most species at `r toronto`. In New Brunswick, the most of the species I observe are near the Bay of Fundy. Kings County (where I spent the summer at my brother Blake's house) has the highest concentration of species I observed at `r kings`.

# Species of interest


Although I try observe a variety of species, there are some that are more abundant, easier to photograph, and that I prefer photographing. **Figure 3**, shows my most commonly observed species throughout the year.

For the first few month of the year, my most observed species included animals that winter in the regions I'm from. These include animals such as red-tailed hawks (*Buteo jamacensis*), and black-capped chickadees (*Poecile atricapillus*). In the spring, I started to observe more species that migrate to Canada during their summer breeding season including song sparrows (*Melospiza melodia*), and the tree swallow (*Tachycineta bicolor*).

By the end of summer my most observed species was the ruby-throated hummingbird (*Archilochus colubris*) with `r hummers` observations. Although I was able to observe many of these energetic birds throughout different parts of Ontario, the vast majority of my hummingbird observations (`r perKingsHum`%) came from Kings County, New Brunswick. In addition to there being several people feeding them around his house, the flower filled field, and stream make for ideal ruby-throated hummingbird habitat.

# Popular clades

Notably, from the racing bar chart above, all of my top 20 most observed species in 2022 were birds. I have a preference for observing animals (particularly vertebrates), mammals are often nocturnal, fish are more difficult to observe because they often live underwater, and, being exothermic, there tends to be fewer species reptiles and amphibians in the parts of Canada I visited in 2022. The following racing bar chart shows the number of species observed by class.

# Variety

In 2022 I observed more species than any other year at `r nUni22`. To represent the diversity of the species observed I use the following phylogeny trees. The root of each tree represents a kingdom, with the leaves representing species. The thickness of the edges and nodes of the tree correspond to the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed.

There are `r trees` trees in the diagram reprenting the kingdoms Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Chromista, and Protozoa. Animalia is by far the largest tree with `r animalia` species, and `r animaliaObs` of observations, followed by Plantae with `r plantae` species, and `r plantaeObs` observations. Protozoa is the smallest tree with `r protozoaObs` observation, `r protozoaCN` (*`r protozoaSN`*).

In 2022 I had `r nLifer22` lifers. Of these lifer `r animaliaLifers` came from the Animalia kingdom, NUMBER from the `r plantaeLifers` kingdom, `r fungiLifers` from the Fungi kingdom, `r chromistaLifers` from the Chromista kingdom, and `r protozoaLifers` from the Protozoa kingdom. Some notable lifers for me include the prothonotary warbler (*Protonotaria citrea*), blandings turtle (*Emydoidea blandingii*), spruce zebra beetle (*Xylotrechus undulatus*), and the short-earred owl (*Asio flammeus*) .




Figure out how to find rares observations by region (Maybe extract summary statistics somehow).

# Focus for 2023

In 2022 I continued to focus heavily on vertebrates in Canada. In 2023, I'd like to expand my focus and observe more species of invertebrates, and organisms outside of the animal kingdom. I would also like to expand my focus geographically, and observe species from outside of Canada.
